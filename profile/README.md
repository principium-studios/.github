# UI Library

We build modular, themeable components with first‑class accessibility and developer ergonomics:

- 🎨 **Styled but Flexible**  
  Ships with sensible defaults, exposes all components and their prop types, uses `twmerge` to merge user‑supplied class names and merges any other props for effortless extension.

- ♿ **Accessible**  
  ~ARIA roles and keyboard support baked in from day one.~

- ⚡️ **Performance‑Focused**  
  Lightweight, tree‑shakable, and ready for production.

- 🛠️ **Developer‑Friendly**  
  Simple APIs, composable primitives, and TypeScript support.
